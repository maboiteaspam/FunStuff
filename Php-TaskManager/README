WHAT IT IS FOR
    A simple piece of php code that helps to manage a
    background task, and get control on them

KNOWN EQUIVALENT PROJECTS
    Gearman, http://gearman.org/?id=gearman_php_extension
            http://www.php.net/manual/fr/gearman.constants.php
    Is much much much more advanced and better than mine
        
LIMITATIONS
    It works only on linux, there is no equivalent for windows
        To know why, have look to http://www.php.net/pcntl
    It works only with cli process, don't try to do it with you Apache web server, it will hangs because of pcnt_fork's call

THINGS TO KNOW
    To re use forked process a memory holder is required,
    to do so, given example (eg example-fork-reuser.php) makes use of a memcache server.
    You may use a File System, or APC as sub layer
    ** need to add an sql based layer **
